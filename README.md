# Collision-Simulator
SImulating correct particle collisions and algorithms to detect them efficiently.

This application uses macroquad for graphics and controls.

The collision effects are based on [this document](https://www.vobarian.com/collisions/2dcollisions2.pdf) and the entire simulation was inspired by [this great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eED4bSkYCB8).
